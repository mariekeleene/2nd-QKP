        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <p>
            My work often teeters on the edge between humor and
            social critique. Inspired by the absurd and sometimes
            ridiculous sides of the world, I create concepts that play
            with both the digital and the tactile. With a background
            in Design, Art, and Technology, my multidisciplinary
            practice blends digital animations with
            materials like textiles and ceramics.

            I aim for laughter, but the kind that lingers—the sort
            that only comes when the underlying absurdity truly
            sinks in. Through a poetic and playful approach, I tackle
            serious themes, often with a touch of mockery or sharp
            wit, while never losing the joy of simply creating
            something fun.
