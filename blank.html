        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <p>
            My work often teeters on the edge between humor and
            social critique. Inspired by the absurd and sometimes
            ridiculous sides of the world, I create concepts that play
            with both the digital and the tactile. With a background
            in Design, Art, and Technology, my multidisciplinary
            practice exists of video, animation, 3D modeling, 3D scanning, installations and whatever fits the concept for example ; pictures of meat.

            love is more thicker than forget
            more thinner than recall
            more seldom than a wave is wet
            more frequent than to fail

            it is most mad and moonly
            and less it shall unbe
            than all the sea which only
            is deeper than the sea

            love is less always than to win
            less never than alive
            less bigger than the least begin
            less littler than forgive

            it is most sane and sunly
            and more it cannot die
            than all the sky which only
            is higher than the sky
